# Needleman Wunsch
Implementation for Needleman Wunch global sequence alignment

1] Implement the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm to align two sequences
with a gap penalty of -2, match score of 2, mismatch score of 1. The output
should display the final score and final alignment.

2] Modify the code written in problem 1 where all the score are
multiplied by -1.
